## 3 - 2021-04-04

### Changed

* backpacks in crate are emptied (added an option to *int_fnc_addCargo*)
* Garrisonned units have more chances to leave their position

## 2 - 2021-03-31

### Changed

* Precision in briefing about chosen spawn point
* Forced ACE night vision settings on mission side to avoid excessive NV fog effect during cloudy nights and to disable NV in sight

### Fixed

* Wrong class name for AT M136 in ammo crate at spawn point (CUP_Weapon_launch_M136 instead of CUP_launch_M136), so launcher wasn't available in ammo crate
* East and west linked spawn points was inverted
